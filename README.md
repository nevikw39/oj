## My low-quality and poor-performance codes submitted to several online judges, such as ZeroJudge, GreenJudge, UVa and TIOJ.

`hello, world`

This is the repo in which I restore my poorly-written, low-quality and awful-performance codes which were submitted to several online judges, inclusive of ZeroJudge, GreenJudge, UVa Online Judge and TIOJ INFOR Online Judge.

### ZeroJudge

> Approximately 482 Accepted, ranking at 149th _(2/3, 2021)_

**ZeroJudge**, commonly abbreviated _ZJ_, is one of the most popular Chinese OJ in Taiwan. It was _ZJ_ that was the very first online judge I engaged in, the outset of my voyage in competitive programming. I signed up on _12/31, 2018_, receiving my first **Accept** on _01:01 01/01, 2019_:) .

### GreenJudge

> Approximately 221 Accepted, ranking at 45th _(2/3, 2021)_

**GreenJudge**, unexceptionally known as _GJ_ as above, is the online judge of Tai-Chuang Girls' High School, which not only has appropriate order of problems for beginners but also contains several years' problems of Regional High School Programming Contest in Tai-Chunag and Chuang-Hua. I **solved** my first problems on this judge on _5/1, 2019_, which was the first day of Reiwa Era _(ã‹¿)_.

Nevertheless, the version of `g++` compiler there is a bit out-dated. The `C++` standard is obsolete `C++98`, which means you cannot use `unoredered_set/map` containers, range-based `for` loop, `auto` type, initialization list, lambda function, et cetra.

### UVa Online Judge

**UVa Online Judge** is probably the oldest and the most well-known online judge throughout the world. I suggest beginners do the exercise in _Rujia Liu's book_ or follow the list by _Steven Halim's Competitive Programming_. In addition, [uHunt](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/) is a good site which can assist you to find plenty of problems.

### TIOJ INFOR Online Judge

[https://tioj.ck.tp.edu.tw/](https://tioj.ck.tp.edu.tw/)

_TIOJ_, a intriguing recursive acronym of **TIOJ INFOR Online Judge** (formerly standing for **Temporary INFOR Online Judge**), is the online judge of INFOR, a club in Chien Kuo High School. It is a modern, cozy and fast online judge above all. Futhermore, _TIOJ_ is composed of a great amount of high-quality problems. [Here](https://tioj.ck.tp.edu.tw/articles/5) is a widely-praised learning resource for those who are eager to refine and sharpen their skills of data structures and algorithms.

### AP325
