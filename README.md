## My low-quality and poor-performance codes submitted to several online judges, such as ZeroJudge, GreenJudge, UVa and TIOJ.

`hello, world`

This is the repo in which I restore my poorly-written, low-quality and awful-performance codes which were submitted to several online judges, inclusive of ZeroJudge, GreenJudge, UVa Online Judge and TIOJ INFOR Online Judge.

### ZeroJudge

[https://zerojudge.tw/](https://zerojudge.tw/)

> Approximately 482 Accepted, ranking at 149th _(2/3, 2021)_

**ZeroJudge**, commonly abbreviated _ZJ_, is one of the most popular Chinese OJ in Taiwan. It was _ZJ_ that was the very first online judge I engaged in, the outset of my voyage in competitive programming. I signed up on _12/31, 2018_, receiving my first **Accept** on _01:01 01/01, 2019_:) .

### GreenJudge

[http://www.tcgs.tc.edu.tw:1218/](http://www.tcgs.tc.edu.tw:1218/)

> Approximately 221 Accepted, ranking at 45th _(2/3, 2021)_

**GreenJudge**, unexceptionally known as _GJ_ as above, is the online judge of Tai-Chuang Girls' High School, which not only has appropriate order of problems for beginners but also contains several years' problems of Regional High School Programming Contest in Tai-Chunag and Chuang-Hua. I **solved** my first problem on this judge on _5/1, 2019_, which was the first day of Reiwa Era _(㋿)_.

Nevertheless, the version of `g++` compiler there is a bit out-dated. The `C++` standard is obsolete `C++98`, which means you cannot use `unoredered_set/map` containers, range-based `for` loop, `auto` type, initialization list, lambda function, et cetra.

### UVa Online Judge

[https://onlinejudge.org/index.php](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php)

**UVa Online Judge** is probably the oldest and the most well-known online judge throughout the world. I suggest beginners do the exercise in _Rujia Liu's book_ or follow the list by _Steven Halim's Competitive Programming_. In addition, [uHunt](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/) is a good site which can assist you to find plenty of problems.

### TIOJ INFOR Online Judge

[https://tioj.ck.tp.edu.tw/](https://tioj.ck.tp.edu.tw/)

_TIOJ_, a intriguing recursive acronym of **TIOJ INFOR Online Judge** (formerly standing for **Temporary INFOR Online Judge**), is the online judge of INFOR, a club in Chien Kuo High School. It is a modern, cozy and fast online judge above all. Futhermore, _TIOJ_ is composed of a great amount of high-quality problems. [Here](https://tioj.ck.tp.edu.tw/articles/5) is a widely-praised learning resource for those who are eager to refine and sharpen their skills of data structures and algorithms.

### AP325

[AP325](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10hZCMHH0YgsfguVZCHU7EYiG8qJE5f-m) is a tutorial written by retired CCU Prof. Bang-Ye, Wu which aims at assisting students to improve thiercapability of programming and grade of APCS _(Advanced Placement Computer Science)_. This tutorial is full of classic and well-designed problems as well as problems appearing in prevous APCS or NHSPC. They are available on [TCFSH CIRC Judge](https://judge.tcirc.tw/Problems?tag=AP325) now.

### AtCoder

**AtCoder** is a renowned Janpanese competitive programming platform, holding beginner, regular and grand contests. I've been participating _AtCoder Beginner Contests_ mostly every week. Yet currrently [my rating](https://atcoder.jp/users/nevikw39) is stuck.

### CSES Problem Set

**CSES Problem Set** is a comprehensive collection of high-quality, classical competitive programming problems held by Antti Laaksonen, a CS professor in University of Helsinki. He also wrote a book named _[Competitive programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)_.

### LeetCode

**LeetCode** is an online judge aimed at preparing one for technical interviews. As a consequence, the difficulity of its problems is not so hard. In addition, it also has some contest. This is [my user page](https://leetcode.com/nevikw39/).

### NTHU OJ & IPHTC OJ

**NTHU OJ** is a OJ for CS department, National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan). It has been stop the registration for those who doesn't take a relatd CS course since 2021 spring, the semester before I enrolled in, due to some traffic and loading problems.

Nonetheless, the smoothness and stability of NTHU OJ are still not so reliable. Therefore, _Introduction to Programming Ⅱ_ by professor Hwann-Tzong, Chen had its own OJ.

For those who is insterested in my solution to the problems of _Introduction to Programming_ by prof. Chen, you might search for the problem tittle, which usually would be the commit message.

### Google Kick Start

**Google Kick Start** is part of programming competitions by Google. Just like its name, in contrast to Code Jam, it's more oriented to the beginners. **Kick Start** now has 8 independent rounds per year, each of which is usually takes place on a Sunday at the end of month in different time zone.

Furthermore, there are also 3 _Coding Practice with Kick Start Session_ every year, in which participants are not ranked and have about 3 or 4 days to solve some problems.

### ITSA

**ITSA** is a project by Ministry of Education, Taiwan. Its online judge collected several past years of National Collegiate Programming Contest (Taiwan) and ICPC Asia regional contests hosted in Taiwan.

### Codeforces

**Codeforces** might be the most well-known competitive programming platform throughout the world, running contests from division 4 to 1. _Div. 4_ round are a bit too easy for me, and I found that _Div. 3_ is most suitable for me now. This is [my profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/nevikw39).
